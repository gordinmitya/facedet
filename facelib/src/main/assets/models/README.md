face.param and face.bin are from original repo's ncnn demo
https://github.com/biubug6/Face-Detector-1MB-with-landmark?tab=readme-ov-file#c++_inference_ncnn

faceDetector.ncnn.param and faceDetector.ncnn.bin are converted with pnnx (new recommended way)
but it fails to do inference with dynamic input size.
